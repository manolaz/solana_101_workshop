## Workshop Projects

Throughout the series, you'll build the following projects with increasing complexity:

### 1. Personal Token (SPL Token)

- Create your own fungible token on Solana
- Implement minting, burning, and transfer functionality
- Set up token metadata and images

### 2. NFT Marketplace

- Design NFT collection and metadata
- Build listing, purchasing, and bidding functionality
- Implement royalties and marketplace fees

### 3. DAO Voting System

- Create governance token and distribution mechanism
- Implement proposal creation and voting logic
- Build treasury management functionality

### 4. DeFi Lending Protocol

- Design token vaults and interest rate models
- Implement collateralization and liquidation mechanisms
- Create borrowing and repayment functionality

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- Fundamental understanding of blockchain concepts
- Development environment with:
  - Node.js v22+ and npm
  - Rust installed via rustup
  - Git for version control
  - Code editor (VS Code recommended with Solana extensions)

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    libudev-dev llvm libclang-dev \
    protobuf-compiler libssl-dev
   ```

   RUST

   ```bash

  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf <https://sh.rustup.rs> | sh -s -- -y

   ```

2. **Install Node.js and npm**
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
   command -v nvm
   nvm install node
   node --version
   npm install --global yarn
   yarn --version
   ```

3. **Install Anchor**

   ```bash
    cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
   avm --version
   avm install latest

   avm use latest

   ```
